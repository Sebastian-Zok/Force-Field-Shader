# Force-Field-Shader
This repository contains a custom shader that provides a smooth transition from transparency to visibility as the camera approaches an object. When applied to an object, the shader initially renders the object as completely transparent. However, as the camera moves closer to the object, the texture of the object gradually becomes more visible, which makes it a perfect choice for a force field that is limiting the play area.
